## 1. Definition
Hypertension, or high blood pressure, is a condition where the force of the blood against the artery walls is too high. 
- Normal: Less than 120/80 mmHg
- Elevated: 120-129 / <80 mmHg
- Stage 1: 130-139 / 80-89 mmHg
- Stage 2: 140+ / 90+ mmHg

## 2. Lifestyle Modifications
- Weight loss: Maintain normal body weight (BMI 18.5-24.9).
- DASH Diet: Consume a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy products with reduced saturated and total fat.
- Sodium reduction: Reduce dietary sodium intake.
- Physical activity: Engage in regular aerobic physical activity such as brisk walking (at least 30 min per day, most days of the week).

## 3. Pharmacological Treatment
- First-line agents: Thiazide diuretics, CCBs, and ACE inhibitors or ARBs.
